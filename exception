In Selenium, various exceptions can be encountered during web automation. Here’s a list of common Selenium exceptions:

1. **WebDriverException**: The base exception class for all WebDriver errors.

2. **NoSuchElementException**: Thrown when an element is not found on the web page.

3. **NoSuchFrameException**: Thrown when the frame is not found in the DOM.

4. **NoSuchWindowException**: Thrown when the window target to be switched doesn’t exist.

5. **NoAlertPresentException**: Thrown when an alert is not found.

6. **ElementNotVisibleException**: Thrown when an element is present in the DOM but is not visible.

7. **ElementNotSelectableException**: Thrown when an element is present in the DOM but is not selectable.

8. **TimeoutException**: Thrown when a command does not complete in enough time.

9. **StaleElementReferenceException**: Thrown when a reference to an element is now stale, meaning the element is no longer attached to the DOM.

10. **InvalidElementStateException**: Thrown when an element is in a state that means actions cannot be performed on it.

11. **NoSuchAttributeException**: Thrown when an attribute of an element is not found.

12. **ElementClickInterceptedException**: Thrown when an element is being covered by another element, making it unclickable.

13. **ElementNotInteractableException**: Thrown when an element is present but cannot be interacted with.

14. **InvalidArgumentException**: Thrown when the arguments passed to a command are not valid.

15. **JavascriptException**: Thrown when executing JavaScript supplied by the user.

16. **RemoteDriverServerException**: Thrown when there is an error in the server.

17. **InvalidCookieDomainException**: Thrown when attempting to add a cookie under a different domain than the current URL.

18. **UnableToSetCookieException**: Thrown when a driver fails to set a cookie.

19. **UnexpectedAlertPresentException**: Thrown when an unexpected alert is presented.

20. **SessionNotCreatedException**: Thrown when a new session could not be created.

21. **MoveTargetOutOfBoundsException**: Thrown when an action cannot be completed as the target is out of bounds.

22. **UnhandledAlertException**: Thrown when an unexpected alert is present and not handled.

23. **ScreenshotException**: Thrown when there is an error taking a screenshot.

24. **UnsupportedCommandException**: Thrown when a command is not supported.

Understanding these exceptions and how to handle them properly is crucial for writing robust Selenium test scripts.
Core Selenium Exceptions
•	NoSuchElementException: This is the most common exception, thrown when an element cannot be found on the page.
•	ElementNotVisibleException: Raised when an element is present on the DOM but not visible.
•	ElementNotInteractableException: Thrown when an element is present but not interactable (e.g., disabled, obscured).
•	StaleElementReferenceException: Occurs when an element is no longer attached to the DOM (often due to page refreshes or AJAX calls).
•	TimeoutException: Raised when an element is not found within a specified wait time (using WebDriverWait).
•	WebDriverException: A general exception for other WebDriver-related errors.
Other Common Exceptions
•	UnexpectedAlertPresentException: Thrown when an unexpected alert is present (e.g., JavaScript alert).
•	NoAlertPresentException: Thrown when an alert is expected but not present.


Selenium provides a range of exceptions to handle various issues that may arise during web automation. Here is a list of common Selenium exceptions and some strategies to resolve them:

### List of Selenium Exceptions and Resolutions

1. **NoSuchElementException**
   - **Cause**: Element cannot be found in the DOM.
   - **Resolution**: Ensure the locator is correct and that the element is present in the DOM. Use explicit waits to wait for the element to be present.
   ```python
   from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
   from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

   element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, 'element_id')))
   ```

2. **StaleElementReferenceException**
   - **Cause**: Element is no longer present in the DOM or has changed.
   - **Resolution**: Refetch the element from the DOM before interacting with it.
   ```python
   element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.NAME, "q")))
   element.send_keys("Selenium")
   ```

3. **TimeoutException**
   - **Cause**: Command did not complete in the specified time.
   - **Resolution**: Increase the timeout duration or ensure that the condition you are waiting for is likely to be met.
   ```python
   element = WebDriverWait(driver, 20).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, 'element_id')))
   ```

4. **ElementNotVisibleException**
   - **Cause**: Element is present in the DOM but not visible.
   - **Resolution**: Ensure the element is visible before interacting with it.
   ```python
   element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.ID, 'element_id')))
   ```

5. **ElementNotSelectableException**
   - **Cause**: Element is present but cannot be selected.
   - **Resolution**: Ensure the element is selectable.
   ```python
   element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.element_to_be_selected((By.ID, 'element_id')))
   ```

6. **NoSuchWindowException**
   - **Cause**: Window target to be switched does not exist.
   - **Resolution**: Verify the window name or handle before switching.
   ```python
   driver.switch_to.window("window_name")
   ```

7. **NoSuchFrameException**
   - **Cause**: Frame target to be switched does not exist.
   - **Resolution**: Verify the frame name or index before switching.
   ```python
   driver.switch_to.frame("frame_name")
   ```

8. **NoAlertPresentException**
   - **Cause**: No alert is present.
   - **Resolution**: Ensure that the alert is present before switching to it.
   ```python
   alert = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.alert_is_present())
   ```

9. **InvalidElementStateException**
   - **Cause**: Element is not in a state that can be interacted with.
   - **Resolution**: Ensure the element is in the correct state before interacting with it.
   ```python
   if element.is_enabled() and element.is_displayed():
       element.send_keys("Selenium")
   ```

10. **ElementClickInterceptedException**
    - **Cause**: Element click was intercepted by another element.
    - **Resolution**: Use JavaScript to click the element or ensure no other element is blocking the click.
    ```python
    driver.execute_script("arguments[0].click();", element)
    ```

11. **JavascriptException**
    - **Cause**: Error occurred while executing JavaScript.
    - **Resolution**: Ensure the JavaScript code is correct and compatible with the browser.
    ```python
    driver.execute_script("return document.title;")
    ```

12. **NoSuchCookieException**
    - **Cause**: The specified cookie is not found.
    - **Resolution**: Ensure the cookie name is correct.
    ```python
    cookie = driver.get_cookie("cookie_name")
    ```

13. **SessionNotCreatedException**
    - **Cause**: WebDriver session could not be created.
    - **Resolution**: Ensure WebDriver is correctly set up and the browser version is compatible with the WebDriver version.
    ```python
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='path_to_chromedriver')
    ```

14. **InvalidSelectorException**
    - **Cause**: The selector used to find an element is invalid.
    - **Resolution**: Ensure the selector syntax is correct.
    ```python
    element = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "div.classname")
    ```

15. **MoveTargetOutOfBoundsException**
    - **Cause**: Target for mouse action is out of bounds.
    - **Resolution**: Ensure the target is within the visible bounds of the browser window.
    ```python
    actions = ActionChains(driver)
    actions.move_to_element(element).perform()
    ```

16. **WebDriverException**
    - **Cause**: A general error occurred in the WebDriver.
    - **Resolution**: Check the error message for specifics and ensure WebDriver and browser are correctly set up.
    ```python
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='path_to_chromedriver')
    ```

### General Tips for Handling Exceptions

- **Use Explicit Waits**: Use `WebDriverWait` and expected conditions to wait for elements to be in the desired state before interacting with them.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Implement retry logic to handle transient issues, such as network delays or temporary glitches.
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Catch exceptions and handle them gracefully, logging errors and taking corrective actions as needed.
- **Element Refetching**: Refetch elements if you expect them to become stale due to page reloads or dynamic content.

These strategies can help you manage and resolve the common exceptions encountered in Selenium WebDriver testing.


In Selenium, the `ActionChains` class provides a way to automate low-level interactions, such as mouse movements, mouse button actions, key press and release actions, and context menu interactions. These actions are useful when performing complex interactions that are not covered by standard WebDriver commands.

Here's an overview of the common actions you can perform using `ActionChains`:

1. **Moving to an Element**:
   - `move_to_element(to_element)`: Moves the mouse to the middle of the specified element.

2. **Clicking and Holding**:
   - `click_and_hold(on_element=None)`: Clicks (without releasing) at the current mouse location or on a specified element.

3. **Releasing**:
   - `release(on_element=None)`: Releases a held mouse button on a specified element or at the current location.

4. **Clicking**:
   - `click(on_element=None)`: Clicks on an element or at the current mouse location.

5. **Double Clicking**:
   - `double_click(on_element=None)`: Double-clicks on an element or at the current mouse location.

6. **Context Click (Right Click)**:
   - `context_click(on_element=None)`: Right-clicks on an element or at the current mouse location.

7. **Dragging and Dropping**:
   - `drag_and_drop(source, target)`: Clicks and holds the source element, then moves to the target element and releases.
   - `drag_and_drop_by_offset(source, xoffset, yoffset)`: Clicks and holds the source element, then moves by the specified offset and releases.

8. **Sending Keys**:
   - `send_keys(*keys_to_send)`: Sends keys to the current focused element.
   - `send_keys_to_element(element, *keys_to_send)`: Sends keys to a specified element.

9. **Performing the Actions**:
   - `perform()`: Performs all the actions queued up.

Here is an example demonstrating the use of `ActionChains`:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.action_chains import ActionChains

# Initialize the WebDriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Open a webpage
driver.get("https://example.com")

# Locate elements
element_to_hover_over = driver.find_element(By.ID, "hoverableElement")
element_to_click = driver.find_element(By.ID, "clickableElement")
source_element = driver.find_element(By.ID, "sourceElement")
target_element = driver.find_element(By.ID, "targetElement")

# Create an ActionChains object
actions = ActionChains(driver)

# Perform a series of actions
actions.move_to_element(element_to_hover_over).perform()
actions.click(element_to_click).perform()
actions.drag_and_drop(source_element, target_element).perform()

# Close the WebDriver
driver.quit()
```

In this example:
1. We move the mouse to an element to hover over it.
2. We click on another element.
3. We drag one element and drop it onto another element.

### Detailed Examples:

**Hovering Over an Element**:
```python
actions = ActionChains(driver)
actions.move_to_element(element_to_hover_over).perform()
```

**Clicking an Element**:
```python
actions = ActionChains(driver)
actions.click(element_to_click).perform()
```

**Double Clicking an Element**:
```python
actions = ActionChains(driver)
actions.double_click(element_to_double_click).perform()
```

**Right Clicking an Element**:
```python
actions = ActionChains(driver)
actions.context_click(element_to_right_click).perform()
```

**Dragging and Dropping an Element**:
```python
actions = ActionChains(driver)
actions.drag_and_drop(source_element, target_element).perform()
```

**Sending Keys**:
```python
actions = ActionChains(driver)
actions.send_keys(Keys.RETURN).perform()
```

These examples illustrate how to use `ActionChains` to perform a variety of complex interactions in Selenium.
